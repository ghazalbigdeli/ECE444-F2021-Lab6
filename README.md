## Part 3: Pros and Cons of TDD
The pros of using TDD starts with better program design. Since the developer has to define tests and goals they want to code to achieve, it's easier to write and format the code. It allows them to keep everything in mind by estimating what each part will achieve, and leads to detailed specifications. Another pro is that it leads to more modular design - since you write the tests first, the code is easy to check.

An obvious con of TDD is that it can be a slow process. You must write the test code before you can begin writing the code, and this can be overly extensive for certain projects. TDD also has low flexibility. If the code needs to be maintained over time, then the tests need to be maintained as well, which can be time-consuming.
